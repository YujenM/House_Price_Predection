# Bengaluru House Price Prediction

This project aims to predict house prices in Bengaluru using a linear regression model. The dataset used for this analysis is sourced from the "Bengaluru_House_Data.csv" file. The script is written in Python and utilizes libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib.

## Overview

- The script performs data cleaning, feature engineering, and builds a linear regression model for predicting house prices.
- It handles missing values, outliers, and categorical data (locations) through various preprocessing steps.
- The linear regression model is trained on the prepared dataset and evaluated using the R-squared score.

## Dataset

- The dataset, "Bengaluru_House_Data.csv," contains information about house prices in Bengaluru.
- It includes features such as size, total square feet area, number of bedrooms, location, and price.

## File Descriptions

- **Bengaluru_House_Data.csv**: The raw dataset.
- **Bengaluru_House_Price_Prediction.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook script containing the code.
- **README.md**: This file, providing an overview of the project.
